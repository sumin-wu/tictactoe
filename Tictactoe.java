/* CONSTRUCTING THE GAME

The TicTacToe class is our control class.

Thatâ€™s just a fancy way of saying it will run the whole game.

When creating a control class for a game, you have to think about the parts of the
game that need representation.

For Tic Tac Toe, we need 2 players and a board. */
