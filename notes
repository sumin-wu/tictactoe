WINNER!

Tic Tac Toe is won by matching 3 of your symbols across, up and down, or diagonally.

In order to accomplish this, the program needs to be able to compare the symbols in each of a
variety of space combinations.

There are actually 8 combinations.

3 across.

3 up and down.

2 diagonally.

THE FULL BOARD

Your board class should have a method to check itself and see if thereâ€™s a winner.

It should do that every time someone takes a turn.

Finally, we need to make sure we handle the possibility (probability?) of a tie game.

The game ends in a tie when the board is full and no one has won.
